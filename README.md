Work on this project started on January 2012 and stopped on January 2014. 
Although the application is fully functional, no support was added for storing the data to a file.

## Prerequisites
Java 6 or later is required to run this program.

## Installation
You can install this program in one of two ways:

1. Runnable jar file:  
Just download `runnable.jar` and run it. Nice and simple.

2. Eclipse:  
Clone the entire directory into your Eclipse workspace. Open Eclipse. 
Here's how you can start the Import the Eclipse Project wizard:  
`File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace`  
Browse for where you cloned the directory to fill in the "Search root directory" field and click Finish.

Enjoy!
